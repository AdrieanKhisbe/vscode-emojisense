## 0.1.0 - May 12, 2017
- Tweak when completions are shown to not get in the way as much. They will no longer show when the colon is prefixed by a letter such as: `a:|`. In these cases, there must also be a letter after the colon before we show suggestions: `a:b|`
- Added `showOnColon` setting to disable automatically showing suggestions when you type a colon.

## 0.0.1 - May 11, 2017
- Initial release
